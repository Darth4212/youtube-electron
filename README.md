# youtube-electron
A electron app for YouTube on Windows built with [nativifier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier). 
Built around the Firefox useragent allowing for login with all credentials being stored locally within the install directory
I most likely won't be updating much simply due to the fact I really don't NEED to unless Google drastically changes url bases. If there are features you would like to see please code them and send a push through for it to be added, I don't really know anything about Electron or coding for it, I simply built this app using [nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) in order to have a desktop app for YouTube

**#Installation/Usage**



Simply download the release from the releases page, run YouTube Electron.exe and start watching!
